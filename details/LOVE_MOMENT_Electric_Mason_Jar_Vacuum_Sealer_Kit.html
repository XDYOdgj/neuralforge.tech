			var commentsList = [{"user":"Favorite Kid","content":"?????<br />I absolutely love the LOVE MOMENT Electric Mason Jar Vacuum Sealer Kit! I\u2019ve been using it for a few weeks now, and it has made my food storage so much easier. I use it to preserve everything from dry goods to leftovers, and it\u2019s been a total game-changer.Pros:?? Easy to Use \u2013 It\u2019s simple to operate. I just place it on the jar, hit the button, and let it run until it stops. It typically stops once the battery percentage reaches its full charge\u2014no guesswork involved.?? Works on Both Regular and Wide Mouth Jars \u2013 This is great because I can use it for all sizes of mason jars, giving me flexibility depending on what I need to store.?? Strong Seal \u2013 The vacuum sealing works great, and I\u2019ve noticed foods stay fresher longer with a tight seal. No more worrying about things going stale!?? Portable and Rechargeable \u2013 The rechargeable feature makes it easy to take it anywhere, and I don\u2019t need to keep buying batteries.Cons:? None so far \u2013 It works exactly as advertised and has been super reliable for me.Final Verdict:If you\u2019re looking for an easy-to-use vacuum sealer that works with mason jars, I highly recommend this product. It\u2019s efficient, reliable, and makes food storage a breeze.

It creates a strong, airtight seal quickly and effortlessly, keeping everything fresh for much longer. The electric pump is compact, easy to use, and saves so much time compared to manual methods. I love that it works with both wide-mouth and regular-mouth jars, making it super versatile. Definitely a must-have for anyone who enjoys meal prepping or storing dry goods!","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-03 20:01:09"},{"user":"Jackie Osborne","content":"I have a machine that uses the bags and vacuums jars but since it\u2019s so big, I do not keep it on the countertop. Which means I rarely use it. Having this item nearby makes it. I can use it anytime I want within seconds. More quiet than the machine I have and does a great job. I got it in red so I wouldn\u2019t lose it in the kitchen. I like to buy things in bulk to save money. This is a great way to quickly seal up and store in a mason jar. I would buy it again.It\u2019s also very convenient that it can do the regular size jars or the wide mouth.","purchase_model":"Color: Red Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-15 20:01:09"},{"user":"turtlewolf","content":"Well made and effective. It's been fabulous in storing fresh veggies and herbs in my fridge for extended periods of time (Thai basil lasted two weeks!). It has been equally effective on the large and small mouth jars. Occasionally a seal will not hold, but if I clean the lip and the top and try again, it has held.Also, it did not hold on a small jar I filled with humus, but I had filled it right to the top and there was hardly any air left to suction. When I removed some of the humus, it sealed just fine. Just got some more mason jars; today's project is to use this to store all of my pantry dry goods like rice, beans, pastas, flours. I recommend purchasing a Canning Jar Opener, such as the JILINWEI one.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-05 20:01:09"},{"user":"Rebecca B.

It works as promised and is easy to use. I have used it for Navy beans, brown & powdered sugar,' refrigerated foods such as cucumbers, celery and left over soup that I didn't want to eat every day. I like the fact that it is small enough that I don't have to store it on my counter top and it can be used for large and small mouth jars. I would definitely recommend this product.","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-29 20:01:09"},{"user":"Missouri mudder","content":"We have been dehydrating fruits and vegetables and have been using a bag- vacuum sealer. Although it works well, the bags are kind of expensive. We have A LOT of mason jars from canning and decided to try this. Works great. seals in about a minute and sems to keep things fresh. Would buy again.","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-17 20:01:09"},{"user":"Ng Angel","content":"I absolutely love this gadget. It works perfectly to vacuum seal my mason jars which btw I use to store my freshly home made juice. I watched another video whereby a lady used this particular item but she stated she vacuum seals for about a minute because she doesn\u2019t really know how long to vacuum seal her mason jars.Well, silly me that don\u2019t read the instructions was doing as the lady did but then yesterday, I started to vacuum seal as usual but I was busy with prepping the fruits and veggies while this little handy dandy device was doing its thing, and then it stopped on its own when it was done vacuum sealing, that\u2019s when it dawned on me that \u2018I should have read the instructions\u2019 to know NOT to vacuum seal for only 60 seconds but to let the thing do its thing and stop on its own\u2019 it vacuum sealed for about 70 seconds. And it was tight as heck! You cannot open the mason jars with your bare hands.I purchased the Canning jar opener ( the lady I watched also suggested purchasing one)Trust me, you need it to be able to open the mason jars. The brand I got is LXLO (canning jar opener )This mason jar vacuum sealer is very durable and easy to clean. The suction power is unmatched. I\u2019m very happy with this product.","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-15 20:01:09"},{"user":"Reads 2 Much","content":"I've only had it a week, but I've gotten several really large mason jars to seal up things like salad fixings that go bad so quickly.So far, so good - I can't speak to long term use yet, but it definitely seals up those jars well.Should be great this coming summer when our blueberry bushes are producing.It'll be nice to keep them fresh in the fridge for slightly longer storage, instead of having to freeze them right away.","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-18 20:01:09"},{"user":"sewingsister","content":"The bag of chowmein noodles filled 3 pints and a jelly jar. ( I had to wash the 4 th one first so not pictured). I end up tossing stale noodles so hoping this will keep them fresh.I got a big bag of craisins and also sealed them.The ones in the jar are still plump.Even closing the zip lock bag they came in the rest are getting dry.Also sealed up dry beans and split peas to add shelf life.I reused canning lids that are not bent.The only\u201dproblem\u201d I had was I ordered one in black for a present and a red one for me.Got two black ones.They work the same but I wanted a red one. ??The natural food store near us suggested the jar vacuum for freeze dry food storage for things you will be using in the next year. (The mylar bags can get expensive)Also for dehydrated food.","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-09 20:01:09"}];
