			var commentsList = [{"user":"Trisha","content":"Perfect size to put on top of the ferment and heavy enough to hold it down. They are glass, so as long as you don\u2019t drop and break them, they are very durable. I have tile floors and I\u2019m not willing to drop one on purpose just to see how it performs under that kind of pressure, but for fermentation, they do their job very well. The design of the little grip on the top makes it easier to remove than no grip at all. The little idea box under the space to write my review is suggesting I say something about versatility and smell. Well, it\u2019s glass, so it doesn\u2019t smell. As for versatility, I suppose you could use one for a paperweight, but I would rather make another jar of fermented red cabbage. I would buy again.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth 8PK   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-14 20:01:04"},{"user":"Me","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"Size: Wide 4PK   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-04 20:01:04"},{"user":"martin lemons","content":"They were what we were looking for and worked great.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide 4PK   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-04 20:01:04"},{"user":"Bill Robinson","content":"Works great for pint jars.

I started my first sauerkraut ferment and was having an awful time keeping my cabbage under the brine. From what I've read, one of the major rules of lacto-fermentation is making sure that whatever you are fermenting remains submerged under the brine to prevent mold growth. Since mold requires oxygen to grow, you can run into mold issues when your ferments float to the top above the brine. A lot of people recommend using a large piece of cabbage to push down the shredded cabbage, but somehow it kept rising above the brine anyways since there wasn't anything weighing it down.So, I purchased the combo pack of the Pickle Pebbles (4 wide mouth pebbles, 4 standard pebbles), and they have done the job perfectly! The larger size fits perfectly in a wide mouth mason jar and the smaller size fits in standard mason jars. So far, I've used them successfully in pint, quart, and half-gallon size jars. As a note, I would still recommend placing a large piece of cabbage over the shredded cabbage before putting the pickle pebble on top in order to help keep all of the small cabbage pieces from floating around the pebble up to the top of the jar. If you have any pieces that float to the top once you put the pebble in, just go ahead and scoop them out. These are very easy to get in and out of the mason jars, which makes them really easy to use. An added bonus is they are extremely easy to clean with just a quick scrub and rinse. I haven't noticed any lingering smells or residues on any of the pebbles due to their nice, smooth finish.Overall, I thought these were a bit pricey when I was debating whether or not to purchase them, but I would definitely purchase them again in a heartbeat. They have taken a lot of the fuss and worry out of my fermenting and have made the whole process much easier. I highly recommend them!","purchase_model":"Size: Wide/Small Combo   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-07-04 20:01:04"},{"user":"M. D. Standifird","content":"I've fermented before without this product, but these glass weights make it so much easier. Sometimes when the fermenting gets going, veggies want to float to the top. This can cause mold or yeast to grow in your ferment. That is bad and can spoil an entire jar.These glass weights hold the produce under the brine. This allows proper fermentation to take place without unwanted contaminants.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide 4PK   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-22 20:01:04"},{"user":"Susan Keefer","content":"I Love These!

They are glass discs.If I had to pick a flaw and take off a half star, it would be that they are not exactly as the description size indicates...but this is being \"extremely\" critical and picky to do, because these are also described as \"handmade\". They look like it too, which in a way is kinda cool.They are described as:Dimensions: 2 3/4 \" Diameter x 3/4 \" Thick x 6 Ounces (170 grams)But only one of four was closest to this and it was 6 ounces (my scale is pretty accurate), a heavy 11/16\" and just under 2 3/4\". Two others weighed at 5.6 ounces and measured a little smaller, and one is 5.3 ounces-2 11/16\" dia. and closer to 5/8\" thickness. If I had to complain, it would be than none were bigger than described...only smaller.Now, I am a very technical person and a metal fabricator by trade; so the reality is the average Harry and Harriet the Homeowner cant even measure things that accurately and can hardly make out 1/16\" in measurements...so I report this more for \"fun\" than anything.They appear to be \"fired\" or molded as the discs they are, rather than cut from a plate of glass which gives them a cool \"imperfect\" look.At first I thought these were extremely expensive for just glass discs, until I shopped in my area to get them or have them made or cut for me. I was wrong, these are not nearly as easy to find as you would think. There is little competition right now for these because the average person would never think of such a thing. If the idea ever caught on, prices may come down but I dont think the vast majority of people are fermenting or high-thinking enough to want something like this for culinary weighting.I haven't checked these for jar fit yet...guess I should have. My first use was to weigh down a bowl full of potato peels in water to keep them for days in the fridge submerged before I was ready to fry them as a side dish (they were delicious). I used all 4 in a bowl and they worked perfectly.If I have any jar problems I'll report back.What came to mind for me is, I pickle stuff, and I was making pickled eggs. If your jar is not packed full and tight, and even if it is, there is that pesky egg or other food you are pickling that wants to float up to the air at the top. These little gems take care of that, they are nice and clear (albeit not perfectly optically clear) and very easy to clean. We even ran them through the dishwasher and they came out just fine.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide 4PK   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-03-19 20:01:04"},{"user":"Sandy","content":"This year I'm making fermented dill pickles.
